        /* Constructors
           There are three ways in which a term structure can keep track of its reference date:
            * the first is that such date is fixed;
            * the second is that it is determined by advancing the current date of a given number of business days;
            * the third is that it is based on the reference date of some other structure.

         * In the first case, the constructor taking a date is to be used;
            * the default implementation of referenceDate() will then return such date.
         * In the second case, the constructor taking a number of days and a calendar is to be used;
            * referenceDate() will return a date calculated based on the current evaluation date,
            * and the term structure and its observers will be notified when the evaluation date changes.
         * In the last case, the referenceDate() method must be overridden in derived classes
            * so that it fetches and return the appropriate date.  */
